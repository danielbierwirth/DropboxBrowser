/// The actual cursor value.
@property (nonatomic, readonly, copy) NSString *value;

/// Expiration time of value. Some cursors might have expiration time assigned.
/// This is a UTC value after which the cursor is no longer valid and the API
/// starts returning an error. If cursor expires a new one needs to be obtained
/// and pagination needs to be restarted. Some cursors might be short-lived some
/// cursors might be long-lived. This really depends on the sorting type and
/// order, e.g.: 1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the
/// created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results
/// cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be
/// suitable for long term polling. 2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by
/// the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get
/// modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration
